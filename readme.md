# CHESS

## WORK IN PROGRESS
*This project is being made via TDD with the red-green-refactor approach. At times this code will smell a little as I try to get tests to pass. I will do my best to avoid that happening in the first place, but I hope it shows a clear evolution compared to code I have written for previous exercises. Consistent refactoring will take place over time, and such smells will be removed to the best of my ability for the finished product. My aim is to demonstrate clear progression in code writing ability, and to show that I can maintain that progression towards clearer, maintainable code.* 

### Assignment:

1. Build a command line Chess game where two players can play against each other.
2. The game should be properly constrained – it should prevent players from making illegal moves and declare check or check mate in the correct situations.
3. Make it so you can save the board at any time
4. Write tests for the important parts. You don’t need to TDD it (unless you want to), but be sure to use RSpec tests for anything that you find yourself typing into the command line repeatedly.
5. Do your best to keep your classes modular and clean and your methods doing only one thing each.
