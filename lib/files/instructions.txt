MOVEMENT

When the game begins, you will see a board that looks similar to this. The chess
board is an 8x8 checkered board, with letters labelling the columns and numbers
labelling the rows. 

The black pieces are located on rows 7 and 8 while the white pieces are located 
on rows 1 and 2.

The white player moves first. To make a move, simply locate the piece you want
to move, enter the coordinate of the piece, then enter the coordinate of the
square you want the piece to land on.

So to move the white pawn on a2 to a4, simply type: 'a2a4' then press Enter.

The board will then be updated to show the move. If enemy pieces are taken, they
will be display in the 'captured pieces section shown above.

If the player attempts to make a move that is not allowed, an error message will
appear and the player will have to enter their move again correctly.


CASTLING

If the game permits, you may make a castling move by typing 'castle', then the
coordinate of the rook to castle with, then pressing enter e.g. 'castlea1' to
castle the a1 rook with the white king. 

All other moves can take place by typing the coordinates directly, including
taking en-passant.


SAVE/LOAD

Save the game at any time by typing 'save' as your move. It will be
automatically saved with the names of both players and the date/time of the
save. 

This save can be loaded by selecting it from the Load menu when the game starts.
